Hello everyone, and welcome to the wonderful world of **R** code writing. I know that starting out with statistical software can be an exercise in patience, but I assure you that you are more than capable of figuring it out. The key is to *keep trying*.
In this brief article, I will explain some of the basics of dealing with writing **R** code. I won’t be going into detail about the different commands you can use or packages you can install (those are very well covered in introductory **R** textbooks or online tutorials). Rather, I will focus on some of the critical skills you need to develop in order to become a confident **R** user. These include:
* How to write code clearly and with a consistent style so others can understand what you are doing.
* How to find and read package documentation and vignettes so you can teach yourself how to use any package you might need.
* How to effectively use search engines to find the answers to your coding problems
* Common coding mistakes to check for when your code won’t run
* Good tutorials for teaching yourself the basics
